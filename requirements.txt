# Requirements for LLMs-from-scratch exercises
# Recommended: Linux OS, CUDA-enabled GPU for deep learning (NVIDIA), Python 3.8+

# Core dependencies
numpy
pandas
torch
scikit-learn
tqdm
tiktoken

# Optional: For GPU acceleration
# torch (with CUDA) - see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

# Note: For best performance, use a machine with an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA drivers installed.
# Some scripts may require large memory and disk space for model/data handling.
